bio: Lauren Murphy, M.S., is a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Saint Louis University studying Industrial-Organizational Psychology. She received her BA in psychology at Butler University in 2016. She is in Dr. Thomas's work-life lab (W.E.L.L.), and her research combines Occupational Health Psychology with Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) to understand how marginalized employees have unique work-life experiences. She is currently a Data Science Intern at Hogan Assessments and is working on projects that focus on validity generalization and diversity-related competencies for selection. In addition, she has assisted several consulting projects for higher education, Fortune 500 companies, and professional organizations where she has worked on focus groups, diversity climate survey analysis, and diversity strategic planning. She hopes to integrate her interests in DEI, data science, and work-family policies to encourage workplace practices to be inclusive for all identities and family structures.
