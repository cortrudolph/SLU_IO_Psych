# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Hannah earned her BA in Psychology from the University of Louisville and her Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) with an emphasis in ESOL instruction from Relay Graduate School of Education. Hannah's research interests stem from her recent history within the secondary education system as both a high school ESOL and English teacher. After spending time as a rural, home visiting case manager, Hannah saw education emerge as a way to change not only individual lives but the trajectory of entire families and even communities. Hannah spent 3 years as a classroom teacher in public schools serving under-resourced communities in both Nashville and St. Louis. Realizing the system of education could benefit from the principles and practices of I/O Psychology, Hannah will focus on education-pertinent topics such as leadership development, talent retention, and systems change. She is interested in pursuing an applied career in education, ready to support great leaders in creating environments for high-functioning, innovative teams.
