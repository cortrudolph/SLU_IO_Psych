abstract: To address the challenges imposed by demographic change, organizations have become increasingly interested in maintaining and improving employeesâ€™ work ability across the working life span. Based on signaling and social exchange theories, we present a study that investigates the indirect influence of age inclusive human resource practices (AIHRP) on work ability through age diversity climate (ADC). Using a 6-wave longitudinal study of n = 355 employees, we model between- and within-person mediated effects using a random intercept cross-lagged panel model. The results of this analysis partially support our mediation hypothesis. Specifically, we found evidence that ADC mediates the influence of AIHRP on work ability at the between-, but not at the within-person level of analysis. These findings have implications for the development of human resource practices that benefit employees at various ages.
