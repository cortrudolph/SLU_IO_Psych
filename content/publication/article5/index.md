abstract: We propose that levity is manifested in three primary facets - Buoyancy, Amusement, and Edification. Buoyancy involves an interaction that is organic in its origin and requires minimal effort. Amusement characterizes a plea- surable interaction that incorporates playful exchanges. Finally, Edification involves an interaction that is psycho- logically uplifting in that it celebrates achievements or corrects behavior in a manner that is easily absorbed and appreciated by the recipient. The following sections include a detailed explanation of each of these three facets of levity.
